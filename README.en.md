OpenSurge for Mac is an open-source, Surge-style macOS gateway and control
plane. Most users can start in same-LAN bypass-router mode: keep the main
router's DHCP enabled, give selected devices stable IPv4 addresses, and point
their gateway and DNS to the Mac. For automatic onboarding across an existing
LAN, choose LAN DHCP takeover; for a separate AP, SSID, or VLAN, use an
isolated downstream LAN. All three modes can optionally enable experimental downstream IPv6 takeover.


Every mode supports independent egress policies for registered devices: use
rule-based routing for both the phone and local Mac, route the game console
through a US-region node, and send the TV through a streaming node. In LAN DHCP
takeover and isolated downstream-LAN modes, phones, TVs, PS5 consoles, and VR
headsets can automatically obtain DHCP/DNS from the Mac without per-device
gateway or DNS changes.

| Mode | Best for | Effect on the existing network |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Same-LAN bypass-router mode (common; recommended first step)** | Starting with selected phones, TVs, game consoles, or other devices | Main-router DHCP stays enabled; selected devices use stable IPv4 addresses and manually point their gateway and DNS to the Mac |
| **LAN DHCP takeover (advanced · automatic onboarding)** | Automatically connecting devices on the same LAN to OpenSurge | Follow the guided flow to disable main-router DHCP and restore it when stopping |
| **Isolated downstream LAN** | A separate AP, SSID, or VLAN | Existing-LAN DHCP stays unchanged; the Mac provides DHCP/DNS and the gateway for the isolated downstream network |

- Import an existing mihomo subscription. OpenSurge takes ownership only of
  gateway-critical fields, and a separate global overlay draft keeps custom
  proxies, providers, group extensions, and rules across subscription refreshes
  without changing the running gateway automatically.
- Use the Web GUI and menu bar app to see which devices are active, how much
  traffic they are moving, and which egress chain they use.
- Temporarily keep the Mac running with its lid closed from either UI. The
  switch is off by default and applies only to the current OpenSurge run.

Under the hood, dnsmasq provides DHCP/DNS and mihomo serves as the proxy
engine. IPv4 uses macOS pf plus forwarding for the native gateway path;
experimental downstream IPv6 uses dnsmasq RA/SLAAC/RDNSS, a macOS BPF packet
broker, and the userspace data plane in the OpenSurge-patched mihomo build.

The repository is also designed as an
[AI-agent-friendly engineering workspace](#an-ai-agent-friendly-engineering-workspace):
project knowledge is versioned beside the code, risky network behavior has
executable proof gates, and virtual-lab plus real-device evidence is fed back
into the next engineering loop.

## Capabilities

**Friendly App experience**

- Use the macOS menu bar app to check status, receive recovery warnings, and
  open the local Web GUI.
- Temporarily prevent idle and lid-close sleep independently of gateway state;
  the non-persistent switch releases when OpenSurge quits or the Mac reboots.
- Import sources, configure the network, route individual devices, check proxy
  health and connectivity, and inspect diagnostics from one control surface.
- Follow a recovery state machine through same-LAN DHCP takeover startup,
  client validation, shutdown, and network restoration.

Start with the [OpenSurge for Mac App User Guide](docs/app-user-guide.md). For
common local-network, TUN, and device configuration questions, see the
[FAQ](docs/faq.md).

**Gateway and proxying**

- Start and stop DHCP/DNS, mihomo, pf NAT, and IPv4 forwarding with rollback.
- Provide explicit proxying through mihomo `mixed-port`.
- Provide transparent proxying through mihomo TUN on macOS.
- Use Tailscale or Headscale as an on-demand mihomo outbound for explicit
  MagicDNS suffixes, Tailnet peers, accepted subnet routes, or an optional
  per-device Exit Node.
- In experimental downstream IPv6 mode, isolated-LAN and whole-LAN DHCP
  takeover use dnsmasq RA/SLAAC/RDNSS for automatic onboarding, while
  bypass-router mode uses manual ULAs. IPv6 traffic does not enter a macOS
  system TUN; the BPF packet broker sends it to the OpenSurge-patched mihomo
  gVisor data plane, which covers TCP, UDP, and QUIC carried over UDP/443 while
  retaining MAC-backed device identity.
- Switch **Rule / Global / Direct** for new local-Mac connections entering
  TUN or the explicit proxy without changing downstream devices. OpenSurge
  leaves macOS system-proxy settings unchanged by default, with an explicit
  TUN-only HTTP/HTTPS coordination option for conflicts involving SafeDNS,
  DNS Proxy, or other Network Extensions.
- Generate a MAC-backed fixed IPv4 lease in DHCP takeover mode, or use a stable
  main-router IPv4 in same-LAN manual-gateway mode, with an independent egress
  policy available in either topology.

**Observability**

- Attribute active-session traffic to DHCP devices or same-LAN registered and
  currently observed devices, showing per-device connection counts, live
  upload/download rates, cumulative bytes, and the dominant mihomo egress chain.
- Test proxy-node reachability and latency in one place, then switch an applied
  Selector from the health view.
- Probe a fixed catalog of real services through the applied mihomo mixed-port
  and current local-Mac mode, showing the three-round median latency, matched
  rule, and actual egress chain.
- Inspect and switch policy groups, inspect imported proxy/rule provider
  status, and view current connections.
- Produce text/JSON status, doctor, logs, and snapshot output, including a
  partial-failure JSON snapshot for diagnostics and UI use.

**Safety and validation**

- Configuration validation, TUN-only transparent proxying, rollback, and an
  explicit recovery contract.
- Isolated virtual-LAN validation of risky network behavior before touching a
  normal LAN.

## Per-device policies

One mihomo process can apply independent policies to registered LAN devices.
DHCP takeover mode gives each device a MAC-backed fixed IPv4 lease. Same-LAN
manual-gateway mode instead uses an IPv4 kept stable by the main router and can
assist registration with current traffic plus ARP-neighbor observations. Both
topologies emit per-device mihomo selector groups and `SRC-IP-CIDR` rules. The installed app
enables per-device policies by default, and the Web GUI keeps them enabled. The JSON
policy file lets each device either follow gateway rules or take a
dedicated device selector before global rules. It also supports direct
device-specific actions such as `REJECT` and domain/IP/protocol/port/rule-provider
overlays. Local/private destinations remain direct in dedicated mode. The
local-Mac Rule / Global / Direct switch does not change those downstream rules;
see [local Mac routing modes](docs/local-mac-routing.md).

The Web GUI rule library manages rule sets, outlet-free routing templates, and
the per-device outlet selected after a match as separate concepts. It includes
an inspectable community Claude Code example, but does not apply that example
to any device by default. Operators supply all other policy content; the empty
starter file remains valid. See [per-device policy overlays](docs/device-policy.md)
for the JSON model, precedence, CLI commands, and validation boundary.

### Tailscale outbound

The **Proxy and rule sources** page can manage one OpenSurge-owned Tailscale
outbound. The Auth Key is write-only and stored in a separate `0600` file;
the persistent `state-dir` keeps the same local Tailnet identity across reloads
and temporary disable/enable cycles. Forgetting that local identity is a
separate action available only while Tailscale and the gateway are stopped,
and does not remove the device from the Tailscale or Headscale admin console.

The inline, collapsible setup panel reads the local Tailscale app in
discovery-only mode and shows
the current Tailnet's MagicDNS suffix, exact peer addresses, online state,
accepted private routes, and eligible Exit Nodes as suggestions that require
confirmation. It never saves or broadens access automatically. A successful
discovery stores a restricted cache without credentials, so configuration can
continue after the local app disconnects. The panel labels the information
source and check/cache time instead of presenting a snapshot as live state. Initial
registration still requires a separate Auth Key; the panel links to the
official Keys page and recommends a one-off, non-Ephemeral key. The local app
and the OpenSurge-managed node do not share login identity or state, and the
advanced manual configuration remains available when discovery is unavailable.

Tailnet-only access is destination-scoped and fails closed. It never becomes a
general device egress. Only an outbound with an explicit Exit Node appears in
per-device outlet selectors. Remote subnet routes must be confirmed explicitly
and are rejected when they overlap the OpenSurge LAN. Mihomo starts its
Tailscale node lazily on the outbound's first request. OpenSurge sends a
best-effort warm-up after gateway start, reload, and mihomo recovery, but the
first application request may still need a retry. Tailnet-only status remains
on-demand instead of being tested against a public `generate_204` URL.

This integration is outbound-only: OpenSurge does not advertise its local LAN,
act as a subnet router, or expose inbound services through the managed node.

## Web GUI and menu bar app

If you installed OpenSurge from a package, start with the
[OpenSurge for Mac App User Guide](docs/app-user-guide.md).

The repository now includes the loopback Go Control API, an embedded React Web
GUI, and a status-focused native SwiftUI menu bar launcher. For a development build:

```sh
make web-install
make control-build
./bin/opensurge-control --config examples/config.example.yaml
make menubar-build
```

The control service listens only on `127.0.0.1` and prints a one-time Web GUI
bootstrap link. The menu bar app shows status and recovery warnings and opens
the Web GUI. Apart from the independent temporary lid-closed-operation switch,
it deliberately has no gateway start/stop or policy-selection actions. It
separates quitting only the menu bar app from quitting OpenSurge.
The latter is available only after the gateway data plane has stopped, and
quits the menu bar app plus the user-level Control Service. The launchd-managed
root Helper remains loaded and idle, so reopening OpenSurge needs no new
administrator authorization.
The menu bar also provides a separate Uninstall OpenSurge action. Once the
gateway is stopped, macOS administrator authorization can remove the app,
Control Service, and root Helper while either preserving configuration data
for reinstallation or deleting everything.
The Web GUI includes a native connectivity page for the applied configuration
plus current local-Mac mode and links to Net.Coffee for a separate browser-local
check. Neither result is presented as proof of downstream gateway rules or a
device's DHCP/DNS/TUN path.
See the [GUI architecture notes](docs/gui-architecture.zh-CN.md) for the current
security and packaging boundary.

`make gui-installer` builds a macOS package after requiring real mihomo and
dnsmasq binaries. Developer ID signing and notarization are opt-in through the
environment variables documented in the architecture notes. Stable GitHub releases
contain explicitly named `arm64-unsigned.pkg` and `x86_64-unsigned.pkg` builds;
a stable Release is never described as signed, notarized, or Gatekeeper-ready.

### Install an unsigned stable GitHub release

Stable releases provide packages for both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Download
`arm64-unsigned.pkg` for Apple Silicon or `x86_64-unsigned.pkg` for Intel, plus
`SHA256SUMS`, from the matching GitHub Release. You can verify downloaded files with
`shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS` and the selected package's GitHub build provenance with:

```sh
gh attestation verify OpenSurge-for-Mac-*-arm64-unsigned.pkg \
  -R YTwsy/OpenSurge-for-Mac
gh attestation verify OpenSurge-for-Mac-*-x86_64-unsigned.pkg \
  -R YTwsy/OpenSurge-for-Mac
```

Double-click the package. If Gatekeeper blocks it, open **System Settings →
Privacy & Security**, choose **Open Anyway**, authenticate, and open the same
package again. Do not disable Gatekeeper globally or recursively remove
quarantine attributes. Finish Installer with an administrator account, then
open **OpenSurge** from `/Applications`. Installation starts the local
helper and Control Service, but the gateway remains stopped until you explicitly
start it from the control plane.

Package upgrades refuse to run while same-LAN DHCP recovery is incomplete.
Before replacing payload files, preinstall stops the menu bar app so it cannot
wake the Control Service, then unloads the user Control Service, runs the
current-version recovery CLI embedded in the new package against the installed
config, and unloads the root helper. The existing config,
imported sources, policy data, and runtime history are kept;
only a first installation seeds `config.yaml` from the packaged example.

## Transparent proxying and downstream IPv6 takeover

OpenSurge uses two transparent data paths with different ingress mechanisms
but shared mihomo rules and outbounds. Downstream IPv4 and local-Mac transparent
proxying use the mihomo TUN mainline; experimental downstream IPv6 enters
mihomo gVisor through the macOS BPF packet broker and the OpenSurge-patched
`opensurge-packet` listener.

Both paths require `transparent.mode: "tun"` as an overall gateway prerequisite,
but downstream IPv6 traffic does not enter a macOS system utun. This does not
reactivate `redir-port` or PF TCP redirection.

### mihomo TUN mainline

Downstream IPv4 and local-Mac transparent proxying use mihomo TUN. Mihomo
`redir-port` and PF TCP redirection remain intentionally unsupported because
the current Darwin build reports redir as unsupported at runtime. Keep
`mihomo.redir_port` and `pf.redirect_tcp_to` at `0`.

OpenSurge does not predict conflicts from existing utun interfaces or public
routes before startup. It waits for mihomo to report the TUN runtime as ready.
Failure gives the process a short cleanup window, rolls back the gateway
runtime, and enriches the actual TUN error with the selected route interface
and gateway. Two full-route TUNs are not supported by default.

### Downstream IPv6 takeover (experimental)

The Network page exposes two independent controls. `dns.ipv6` decides whether
OpenSurge DNS answers AAAA queries and creates fake IPv6 addresses.
`transparent.tun_ipv6` controls the downstream IPv6 gateway, SLAAC/RDNSS, and
userspace packet path, with `off`, `auto`, and `always` modes. `auto` activates
only when the upstream interface has both a public global IPv6 address (ULA
does not count as public reachability) and an IPv6 default route. `always`
establishes the downstream path even without native upstream IPv6.

All three topologies require `transparent.mode: "tun"`. Isolated downstream
LAN publishes RA/SLAAC/RDNSS automatically. Same-LAN DHCP takeover can do the
same for the whole LAN after the main router's IPv6 RA/DHCPv6 is disabled (or
RA Guard makes OpenSurge the only default-router provider) and
`transparent.ipv6_shared_l2_ready: true` is confirmed. Both automatic modes
use the standard Medium RA router preference. Bypass-router mode sends no RA:
only clients manually configured with an OpenSurge ULA, the Mac's link-local
default gateway and DNS address, and no competing router default route
are enrolled. The Network page shows an IPv4/IPv6 fill-in card.

This IPv6 data plane depends on the `opensurge-packet` listener added to mihomo
by OpenSurge. The mihomo binary in OpenSurge packages is built from pinned
upstream source after applying the packet-listener patch in
[`patches/mihomo`](patches/mihomo/); it is not an unmodified upstream binary.
Exact versions, licenses, and upstream sources are listed in
[Third-Party Notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Downstream IPv6 traffic does not enter a macOS system utun. The macOS BPF
broker reads the IPv6 L3 packet and source MAC from the physical Ethernet frame
and passes them through a mode-`0600` Unix datagram to the `opensurge-packet`
listener. The listener injects the packet into mihomo gVisor, maps the MAC to
`IN-USER(device:<id>)`, and reuses the existing device rules and outbounds.
Return packets travel back through the broker to the downstream Ethernet. This
path covers TCP and UDP. QUIC is carried over UDP/443; this is not a claim that
arbitrary IPv6 protocols are proxied.

Per-device **Direct via main router** in DHCP takeover bypasses only IPv4.
When downstream IPv6 is enabled, IPv6 from that device that reaches the
OpenSurge packet path receives a highest-priority `REJECT`; other devices keep
their normal IPv6 policy. The client may still retain SLAAC addresses or RDNSS,
so the UI says **IPv6 egress blocked** rather than claiming IPv6 is absent. If
the main router still publishes RA, the client can bypass OpenSurge over IPv6;
disable the main-router RA/DHCPv6 or enforce RA Guard.

`always` does not invent public IPv6 connectivity. With no native upstream
IPv6, fake IPv6 destinations can still use a proxy that supports the required
traffic, while `DIRECT` to a real public IPv6 address has no upstream route.
An HTTP-only proxy cannot carry UDP/QUIC.

## Mihomo profiles

OpenSurge for Mac can render a managed mihomo config or import an existing
mihomo profile. In imported mode, OpenSurge keeps owning gateway-critical
fields such as LAN binding, `allow-lan`, the DNS listener/fake-IP range, TUN,
`external-controller`, and runtime paths. The imported profile contributes
`proxies`, `proxy-providers`, `proxy-groups`, `rule-providers`, and `rules`, plus
its non-gateway DNS resolver/filter fields. Preserving fields such as
`nameserver-policy`, `proxy-server-nameserver`, and `fake-ip-filter` keeps proxy
server hostnames resolvable without allowing the profile to replace the
gateway DNS listener or TUN DNS contract.

```yaml
mihomo:
  profile_mode: "imported"
  profile: "./profiles/home.yaml"
  store_fake_ip: true
```

Relative `mihomo.profile` paths are resolved from the OpenSurge config file's
directory. Relative `path:` entries inside imported `proxy-providers` and
`rule-providers` are resolved from the imported mihomo profile's directory.
OpenSurge renders `profile.store-selected: true` so mihomo can persist policy
group choices across restarts. The default `mihomo.store_fake_ip: true` renders
`profile.store-fake-ip: true` and restores existing fake-IP mappings after an
apply/restart. You can disable it while the gateway is stopped under **Advanced
Mihomo / DNS settings**, but cached fake IPs held by long-running processes may
then become stale after mihomo restarts.

Preview the final generated mihomo config before starting gateway services:

```sh
go run ./cmd/omg doctor --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg render-mihomo --config examples/config.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg render-mihomo --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml
```

Use `validate-mihomo` when `mihomo.binary` points to an installed mihomo binary.
It renders the final config and runs mihomo's own `-t` validation without
starting gateway services.

```sh
go run ./cmd/omg validate-mihomo --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml
```

## CLI usage

These commands are intended for development, automation, and diagnostics.
Package users can follow the graphical workflow in the
[App User Guide](docs/app-user-guide.md).

### Status and diagnostics

```sh
go run ./cmd/omg doctor --config examples/config.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg status --config examples/config.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg status --config examples/config.example.yaml --format json
go run ./cmd/omg logs --config examples/config.example.yaml --tail 50 --format json
go run ./cmd/omg snapshot --config examples/config.example.yaml --tail 50 --format json
```

### Policies, devices, and providers

```sh
go run ./cmd/omg policies --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg policy-select \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml \
  --group Proxy \
  --policy DIRECT

# Local-Mac Rule / Global / Direct (downstream devices remain unchanged):
go run ./cmd/omg local-routing \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg local-routing-set \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml \
  --mode global \
  --policy Proxy

# After configuring device_policy.file:
go run ./cmd/omg devices --config ./config.yaml --format json
go run ./cmd/omg device-policy-select \
  --config ./config.yaml \
  --device alice-phone \
  --slot default \
  --policy DIRECT

go run ./cmd/omg connections \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml \
  --format json
go run ./cmd/omg providers \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml \
  --format json
go run ./cmd/omg provider-update \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml \
  --provider demo-provider \
  --format json
```

### Config rendering

```sh
go run ./cmd/omg render-mihomo --config examples/config.example.yaml
go run ./cmd/omg validate-mihomo \
  --config examples/config.imported-profile.example.yaml
```

### Gateway lifecycle

The following commands modify DHCP, DNS, PF, IPv4 forwarding, or mihomo runtime
state and require `sudo`:

```sh
sudo go run ./cmd/omg start --config examples/config.example.yaml --format json
sudo go run ./cmd/omg reload --config examples/config.example.yaml --format json
sudo go run ./cmd/omg restart-mihomo --config examples/config.example.yaml --format json
sudo go run ./cmd/omg stop --config examples/config.example.yaml --format json
```

Additional behavior:

- `policy-select` reads live mihomo policy groups and rejects unknown groups or
  policies before sending a selection change.
- `provider-update --provider <name>` asks mihomo to refresh the selected proxy
  provider and returns its refreshed state.
- `logs --tail N --format json` returns recent dnsmasq and mihomo log lines with
  per-file existence and read-error fields.
- `snapshot --format json` aggregates status, doctor checks, leases, logs,
  policy groups, connections, and providers. Mihomo API failures do not prevent
  the rest of the snapshot from being returned.
- `restart-mihomo` restarts only the proxy engine. It does not stop dnsmasq,
  unload PF, restore IPv4 forwarding, or change host network settings.
- `--format json` preserves non-zero failure exit codes and emits structured
  errors to stderr. Successful `start` and `stop` operations return `command`,
  `ok`, and `config_path` in their payloads.

## An AI-agent-friendly engineering workspace

OpenSurge treats the repository as part of the engineering system, not merely a
place to store code. The goal is to make product intent, network safety rules,
runtime evidence, and accumulated project knowledge directly legible to both
human contributors and coding agents.

### Harness Engineering: engineer the environment around the agent

The workspace applies the practical idea behind
[Harness Engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/): reliable
agent work depends on the context, constraints, tools, observability, and
acceptance gates around the model.

- `AGENTS.md` is the compact entry map: it states product identity, hard network
  invariants, and which deeper documents an agent must read for a task.
- [`docs/agent-wiki/`](docs/agent-wiki/README.md) provides progressively
  disclosed architecture, decision, and validation context instead of forcing
  every task to rediscover the repository from scratch.
- Machine-readable CLI surfaces such as `status`, `doctor`, `logs`, and
  `snapshot`, plus deterministic `make` targets and retained artifacts, make the
  running system observable to agents.
- Config validation, TUN-only transparent routing, rollback behavior, isolated
  labs, and explicit recovery contracts turn safety guidance into enforceable
  boundaries.

### Loop Engineering: close the loop with executable evidence

OpenSurge follows the core of
[Loop Engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/loop-engineering/): design a
repeatable system that can act, observe, verify, recover, and carry the result
into the next iteration, rather than relying on a single clever prompt.

```text
intent + constraints
        ↓
AGENTS.md → Agent Wiki → source of truth
        ↓
implement → fast tests → Virtual LAN Lab
        ↓
ADB-assisted or manual real-device validation
        ↓
logs + artifacts + cleanup/recovery proof
        ↓
durable learning returns to sources/ and wiki/
        ↺
```

The verification layers are complementary:

- `make test` and focused UI/control-plane gates provide the fast inner loop.
- The Lima + socket_vmnet Virtual LAN Lab makes privileged DHCP, DNS, pf/NAT,
  forwarding, TUN, policy, rollback, and cleanup behavior reproducible without
  risking a normal LAN.
- Real-device and same-LAN/same-WiFi runners close the physical-topology loop.
  ADB can collect Android route, DNS, and connectivity evidence while the Mac
  side correlates dnsmasq/mihomo logs; manual phone checkpoints remain supported
  when the operator needs to retain direct control.
- Recovery is part of acceptance for risky DHCP takeover flows. A successful
  traffic probe alone is not enough if the router, Mac, or clients cannot be
  returned to a known-good state.

Virtual Lab results do not stand in for real-device behavior, and one physical
smoke does not replace the deterministic Lab gates. See the
[validation contract](docs/agent-wiki/wiki/concepts/validation-gates.md) for the
exact claim each gate is allowed to support.

### Agent Wiki: externalized project memory

The [Agent Wiki](docs/agent-wiki/wiki/index.md) applies the LLM Wiki idea of
moving durable memory out of a transient context window and into a small,
versioned, source-backed knowledge layer:

- `docs/agent-wiki/sources/` records stable project briefs, decisions, and
  validation contracts.
- `docs/agent-wiki/wiki/` distills those sources into short, linked pages that
  an agent can load progressively for the task at hand.
- `.codex/hooks.json` integrates the local Session Wiki hook, when installed,
  so session continuity and compaction can use project-local memory without
  committing private session state.

Only reusable, verified knowledge belongs in this layer. One-off logs,
temporary output, unverified guesses, and ordinary TODOs do not.

## License

OpenSurge for Mac original code and assets without a separate notice are
licensed under the [GNU General Public License version 3 only](LICENSE)
(`GPL-3.0-only`). Bundled third-party programs and libraries retain their own
licenses; see [Third-Party Notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), including exact
corresponding-source links for the bundled mihomo and dnsmasq versions.

## Safety

`start` and `stop` are intended to run with `sudo` because they manage DHCP,
pf, and IPv4 forwarding. Runtime files are written under `runtime.dir` from the
config file.

## Development workflow

Use `make test` as the fast default gate. CI currently runs this unit-test gate
only, so ordinary pushes and pull requests do not need host networking,
passwordless sudo, Lima, or socket_vmnet.

Run `make lab-test` locally before committing or reviewing high-risk network
changes. This includes changes to DHCP, DNS, mihomo startup/config rendering,
pf rules, forwarding/rollback behavior, gateway lifecycle, lab scripts, and
example configs that affect runtime traffic. Keep the virtual LAN lab as a
local, nightly, or manual gate until a dedicated macOS runner can provide the
same controlled host privileges and network isolation.

Use `make lab-test-tun` for the supported transparent proxy path. That test
keeps clients proxy-free and requires mihomo to log the direct HTTPS connection
through its TUN inbound. Use `make lab-test-tun-imported-profile` when changing
mihomo profile import or overlay behavior; it runs the same TUN gate with an
imported profile fixture. Use `make lab-test-tun-imported-egress` when changing
imported provider or policy-selection behavior that should affect transparent
TUN traffic; it uses a local HTTP provider and controlled HTTP CONNECT proxy to
prove `policy-select` changes the TUN egress path between `DIRECT` and the
controlled proxy.

Use `make lab-test-tun-local-routing` when changing the local-Mac
Rule/Global/Direct selectors or the local-vs-downstream isolation boundary. It
proves both directions: local Global can use the controlled proxy while a
downstream client remains on direct gateway rules, and local Direct can bypass
the proxy while the downstream gateway rule still uses it.

Use `make lab-test-tun-device-policy` when changing MAC reservations,
per-device selectors, or the device override data path. It proves that two
clients receive their own fixed leases, can independently select different TUN
egress paths, and enforce a device-level domain `REJECT`. Domain/protocol rule
compilation, templates, and HTTP/MRS rule-provider configuration are covered by
unit tests; they do not require one Lab run per operator-defined rule.

Use `make lab-test-tailscale` when changing Tailscale destination/source rules,
MagicDNS, managed-tsnet configuration, or native-app discovery. A dedicated
Lima Tailnet peer verifies TCP/UDP to an exact peer IP, the complete MagicDNS
name, Control API discovery, one-device authorization, and fail-closed behavior
for the other device. The peer-observed source address also rules out a false
positive through the Mac's native Tailscale route. The first run needs external
mode-`0600` auth-key files for the peer and managed node: either two one-off keys
or one reusable, non-Ephemeral key shared by both file variables. Persisted
identities make ordinary reruns keyless. This bounded gate does not prove a
subnet router, Exit Node, Headscale, or a real remote LAN.

When changing downstream RA/SLAAC, the BPF broker, the patched Mihomo packet
listener, IPv6 device identity, or withdrawal on stop, run the topology gates:
`make lab-test-ipv6-userspace`, `make lab-test-ipv6-same-wifi`, and
`make lab-test-ipv6-same-lan`. Automatic-RA gates require two clients to
obtain OpenSurge IPv6 addresses, Medium-preference default routes, and
link-local DNS. The bypass-router gate requires manual ULAs, the Mac
link-local default gateway and DNS, and no RA. All three use controlled local
fixtures to verify TCP, a UDP request/response, a QUIC-shaped UDP carrier, and
a real HTTP/3-only request/response with no TCP or HTTP/2 fallback. HTTP/3 is
checked through `DIRECT`, a controlled UDP-capable SOCKS5 outbound, and an
HTTP-only fail-closed outbound, together with per-device policy, bidirectional
BPF evidence, and rollback. This bounded gate does not cover every QUIC/HTTP3
implementation, version, connection-migration case, or public proxy
combination.

Use `make policy-control-test` for policy-control and machine-readable CLI
changes. It starts the real mihomo binary without sudo, dnsmasq, pf, or TUN and
checks `policies`, invalid and valid `policy-select`, persisted selection
restore after mihomo restart, local/private `DIRECT` guards through
mihomo's mixed-port, the dedicated local-routing mode controller,
`connections`, `providers`, `provider-update` for file and HTTP proxy
providers, and `snapshot` against the live external-controller API.

Use `make same-lan-start-tun` and `make same-lan-adb-check` for the narrow
same-LAN default-gateway smoke. This gate keeps DHCP disabled, requires TUN, and
uses ADB to inspect one Android test device whose gateway and DNS point at the
Mac's LAN IP. Use `make same-lan-start-tun-proxy` with `OMG_SAME_LAN_*`
upstream-proxy environment overrides to prove one-domain real proxy egress, such
as `api.ipify.org`, before importing a full subscription. Use
`make same-lan-start-tun-imported-egress` plus
`make same-lan-adb-check-imported-egress` for the closer-to-real-device smoke
that imports a provider-backed `TunEgress` group, then switches same-LAN TUN
traffic from `DIRECT` to a controlled local HTTP CONNECT proxy. These gates do
not claim whole-LAN rollout readiness or real remote subscription exits.
When ADB is intentionally unavailable, the same imported egress evidence can
be collected with manual Android browser probes; see
[`tests/same-lan/README.md`](tests/same-lan/README.md#manual-phone-check-without-adb).

For a dedicated test Wi-Fi where router DHCP is manually disabled, use
`make same-wifi-dhcp-start-imported-egress`, then reconnect the Android client
in DHCP mode and run `make same-wifi-dhcp-adb-check-imported-egress`. This
separate high-risk runner uses `gateway.mode: "same_wifi_dhcp"` and requires an
explicit protected-static-address list plus an operator confirmation that router
DHCP is disabled. Its stop gate verifies OpenSurge cleanup, but router DHCP and
client automatic addressing must still be restored manually; see
[`tests/same-lan/WIFI-DHCP-RUNNER.md`](tests/same-lan/WIFI-DHCP-RUNNER.md).

## Virtual LAN lab

The integration lab runs the real macOS gateway against two lightweight Linux
clients. Lima provides the clients, while socket_vmnet creates an isolated
Layer 2 host network without a competing DHCP server. The test covers DHCP,
DNS, ICMP/NAT, direct HTTPS, and explicit HTTPS through mihomo `mixed-port`.

```sh
make lab-install
make lab-up
sudo -v
make lab-test
make lab-test-tun
make lab-test-tun-imported-profile
make lab-test-tun-imported-egress
make lab-test-tun-device-policy
make lab-test-tailscale
make lab-test-ipv6-userspace
make lab-test-ipv6-same-wifi
make lab-test-ipv6-same-lan
make lab-down
```

The one-time installer adds a root-owned, fixed-function network helper and a
narrow sudoers rule for starting, stopping, and inspecting the lab network. The
gateway binary itself is not granted passwordless root access; refresh the sudo
ticket with `sudo -v` before an end-to-end test. See `tests/lab/README.md` for
the topology, safety checks, and troubleshooting steps.
